This is the ui part of the stdout.online app. The idea behind this app is to be able to log text from anywhere with 
no previous setup. The resulting log messages are viewable in real time in the browser. 

Installation
- create `/config/config.php` based on `/config/config.php.dist`
- make index.php accessible via a web server (eg Apache)
